# Welcome to DiskSpaceAnalyzer!
It is a simple desktop app which allows you to browse the filesystem on your computer. The directory tree is displayed on the left and after you start the app it will display all disk partitions. You can change that by clicking select and choosing only a specified partition or just a directory.

When you click a directory name on the directory tree, the app will start counting subdirectories and files of the selected directory in the background. The progress will be indicated by the progress bar located in the bottom-left corner. This process can be interrupted by clicking **File -> Cancel**. Once the work is finished you will see the the details displayed on the right. You can also see more details if you click charts and select one of the available options.

You can find some screenshots of the app in Screenshots.md
